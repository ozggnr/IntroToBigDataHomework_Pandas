“What is the effect of the other people’s opinions on a person’s decision of buying a book?”

If we assume that ‘text_reviews_count’ column in our dataset represents the reflection of
other people’s opinion, and ‘ratings_count’ and ‘average_ratings’ columns represent the person’s
decision of buying book, we can then reveal their relationship. To do so, we can simply look at their
correlations. Correlation between ‘text_reviews_count’ and ‘rating_count’ is 0.86, which indicates they are
highly correlated and therefore it can be concluded that person’s decision of buying a book strongly depends
on people’s opinion. On the other hand, correlation between ‘text_reviews_count’ and ‘average_rating’ is 0.04,
which indicates that they are almost independent from each other and therefore it shows person’s decision of
buying a book does not depend on other people’s opinions. We need to understand data more clearly in order to
be sure that which column, ‘average_rating’ or ‘ratings_count’, represents a person’s decision of buying a book
in reality.
